        <h3>TCNHS History</h3>
        <p>In 1986, A Community High School Was Proposed By The Late Mr. Augusto Alejandrino, The Then-District Supervisor Of Northern Tabuk District.
         It Was A Public School By The Ministry Of Education Without Co<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
		gressional Act or executive order of its opening. The permit to open was granted by the Division Office of Kalinga-Apayao, without the benefit 
		of classrooms and budgetary outlay. The school had two sections and three teachers, namely Mrs. Dominica Villamor, Mrs. Lolita Castillo, and Mr. Desiderio Orprecio.
         <br> <br>In 1970, the Provincial Government of Kalinga-Apayao headed by Hon. Amado Almazan approved a resolution converting the newly established Community High School 
		 to Kalinga-Apayao Provincial School. With the increase of enrollees, the third and fourth-year curricula were opened. All available rooms of Tabuk Central School were utilized 
		 in order to solve the problems of accommodation.<br> <br> The Provincial Government and the Division Office proposed a school budget which was good for twenty-four teaching positions.
	     However, upon the opening of classes for the school year 1970-1971, thirty-three teachers were employed. The hiring of more teachers which is not in accordance with the budget resulted in
	     the delay in their salaries. Despite the sad experiences of these teachers, they never relaxed in their classroom activities in imparting knowledge to their students. <br> <br> In April 1971,
	    the first graduation of the Kalinga-Apayao Provincial High School took place. There were 53 graduates composed of 27 boys and 26 girls. The graduation was so memorable and gratifying to note for
	    many of the graduating students passed the qualifying government examinations for possible scholarships in college.<br><br> Among them was Miss Karen Sarmiento who passed the examination. She is the 
	    first Valedictorian of Kalinga-Apayao Provincial High School.<br> <br> In 1973, Republic Act No. 6470 mandated the conversion of the Kalinga-Apayao Provincial High School to Tabuk National High School. 
	    In June 1973, Superintendent Epifanio T. Ramos appointed Mrs. Joaquina C. Falgui as the first Principal of the Tabuk National High School.<br> <br>On June 27, 1988, President Corazon C. Aquino, through 
	    Proclamation No. 227, awarded Lot 1461, PS-93 with an area of 32,233 square meters to the Tabuk National High School.<br> <br>Tabuk City National High School has been producing desirable graduates for the
	    community and the larger society as a whole. The school is now headed by Mrs. Mildred Sadagan Cabay. Her predecessors are: Dr. Rodolfo C. Ballog, Mr. Augusto Alejandrino, Mrs. Juaquina C. Falgui and Mrs. 
	     Purificacion E. Domingo.</span></p>
